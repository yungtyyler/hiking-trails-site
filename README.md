# Bootstrap Project
## Find My Trail 2023
### By Tyler Varzeas

This web application was created as a front-end bootstrap project to practice and get used to the different tags and tools that bootstrap provides for making a website look great, be responsive on all devices, and feel smooth to navigate.

This application has potential to be expanded upon in the near future with Nucamp's Full Stack Web Development course to make it a functional application for finding nearby hiking trails and providing safety information for those ready to explore.

More future additions to the application include database connectivity and user authentication.
